----------------------

This is an Ansible playbook for automating the provisioning of a server for
hacking on or running the [robcutmore.com](http://www.robcutmore.com) website.
The website is currently being developed and run on Ubuntu.

This README will be fleshed out more fully in the future as this playbook is
still a work in progress.
